## 🎮 Game Description

**Chomp Champs** is a 2D top-down action-survival game inspired by *Feeding Frenzy*, where you play as a hungry aquatic creature aiming to eat smaller prey, avoid larger predators, and grow into the apex of the food chain. With simple controls and pixel-style visuals, the game delivers a fun, arcade-like experience while showcasing core Unity development techniques.
