## 🎮 Game Description

**Chomp Champs** is a 2D top-down action-survival game inspired by *Feeding Frenzy*, where you play as a hungry aquatic creature aiming to eat smaller prey, avoid larger predators, and grow into the apex of the food chain. With simple controls and pixel-style visuals, the game delivers a fun, arcade-like experience while showcasing core Unity development techniques.

- **Hazards & Enemies**: Avoid predators and environmental dangers like mines or toxic jellyfish.
- **Pixel-Art Aesthetics**: Retro-inspired visuals with hand-crafted sprites and effects.
- **Multiple Levels**: Different aquatic environments with increasing difficulty.
